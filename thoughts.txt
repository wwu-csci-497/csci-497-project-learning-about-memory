First page will be for a Table of Contents.
This will allow users to navigate through the lesson.

First lesson will be about Working Memory.
It'll begin by asking the user to play Miller's (1956) Experiment.
Then it'll allow the user to reflect, and tell them what's going on.

Afterwards, they'll be introduced to chunking,
where they'll be needed to demonstrate it.
Again, the user will have to reflect and understand why this works.

Finally there will be a short quiz on the previous concepts.



This will be the behavior loop for the site.
This loop will happen twice: once for memory, and a second time for studying
